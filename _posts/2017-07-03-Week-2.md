Hello there again.

The second week at crate was really exciting for me, since I got to work on the node.js sample app up until friday. The first 
"draft" of the app was ready on wednesday i belief, but when I run the tests they failed because I forgot to add the right
response codes, which the test wanted. So from wednesday to friday I tried to get the tests running, which was quite some work
because I had do check which responses the test really wants, but in the end it worked out. The most frustrating thing about
the sample app was the tests for the images, because the error was not in my code but in the test. The reason why the test 
failed for the images was the fact that it uploaded the image and then it instantly tried to get the image again, which 
resulted in the image not being in the database at that point. So the test failed. It took me quite a while to find that, since 
i thought that I could rely on the test. In the end I added a small function in the test that would pause it for a few seconds 
if needed.

So well, that was most of my second week at @crate and I am looking forward to more challenges :)
