This week i continued working with the POC team until wednesday, on monday I was able to finish the updating of the MQTT plugin
with the help of a teammember. After that i hat some impediments concerning failed builds in a documentation and a few other
things. Wednesday then came and it was an amazing day, because the whole team from Berlin came down to Dornbirn, furthermore a 
few people from the american team and one from the UK came too. We had a huge meeting all together and after the meeting was 
over we all drove to the Bodensee to have barbeque and beer together. It was a fun day.
On thursday and friday i worked on a problem with installing crate on ubuntu 14.04 and after that there were also problems with
crate-pdo which I tryed to fix.
