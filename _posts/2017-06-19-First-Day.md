I had to come in at 9AM and Johannes introduced me and my fellow colleague Alex (also an intern at Crate) to the office that Crate is in. After showing us everything we talked about how the working flow is at crate and afterwards we had the possibility to take part in our first "Nexus", which is like a daily scrum for all the developer teams. After that we had our first team meeting with Johannes and we talked about our tasks for our first week. Furthermore we had lunch with the whole crate team, because each monday one employee at crate cooks for everyone, and it was delicious. Now I started working on writing my blog and later i will start working with the sample apps of Crate.
